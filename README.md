DeepGo: A simple Search Engine for the Curious
 A prototype for a basic web crawler that can function as a java stand alone GUI on your windows or MAC PC. 
 Not really anything fancy just demonstrates how web crawling is done using one seed link to help you navigate through several 
 Articles according to the keyword mentioned in the search bar. 
 
 
 Tip: 
 1. Execute Deepgo.java file.
 2. If file does not execute please look for Images DeepBlueWallpaper.jpeg and Paperback.jpeg, copy their links and paste them in 
 the image retrieval commands on lines 359 and 361.
3. If you don't have time to run the code, here is the link to the video to show how it works :
